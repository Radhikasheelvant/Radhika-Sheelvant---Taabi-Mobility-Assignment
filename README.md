# Radhika-Sheelvant---Taabi-Mobility-Assignment
**Assignment Objectives:
**
Data loading and preparation:
▪ Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
▪ Identify the types of variables (numerical, categorical, etc.).
▪ Determine the size of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
▪ Identify missing values and any irregularities in the data.

Data cleaning and preprocessing:
▪ Handle missing values appropriately.
▪ Convert data types if necessary.
▪ Handle duplicate records, if any.
▪ Handle outliers, if any

Exploratory data analysis:
▪ Perform univariate analysis on numerical and categorical features.
▪ Perform bivariate analysis to find relationships between different variables.
▪ Create visualizations to support your findings.
▪ Identify outliers and unusual patterns.

Feature Engineering:
▪ Create new features from existing data that could provide additional insights.
▪ Standardize or normalize features if necessary.

Insights and Recommendations:
▪ Provide a summary of the key insights derived from your analysis.
▪ Based on your findings, make recommendations that could help improve vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, safety, or emissions.

**Summary of key insights and recommendations based on the analysis
**
1.	Data quality and cleaning
•	Some columns from the dataset has missing values  so they were dropped to maintain the data integrity.
•	Duplicate records also removed to avoid the biased results.
2.	Data cleaning and preprocessing:
•	The columns which are having the some missing filled with the mean values.
•	Dataset contains some categorical columns they were converted to the numerical columns.
3.	Outlier detection:
•	Using boxplot outliers were detected for all columns.
4.	Univariate analysis:
•	Using histogram univariate analysis has been done.
5.	Bivariate analysis:
•	Using scatter plot detected relationship between the two variables.
6.	Feature Engineering:
•	New feature time and distance per fuel has been created to gain some more insights.
7.	Standardization:
•	Using Standard scaler normalized all the features for further analysis.

Recommendation:
1.	Fuel efficiency – Monitor the parameters fuel consumption and fuel rate to identify the patterns and optimize the use of the fuel.
2.	Safety – Ensure Safe driving speed for the safety purpose and also fuel consumption
